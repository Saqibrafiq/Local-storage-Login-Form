# Login Form with Local Browser Storage

Simple HTML Css and Javascript Login form. I used pseudo element and classes as hover, after, before, and active in order to hide and make content visible.

This Login form is functional pages like Login, Create a new Account, Forget your password? 

In create a new Account, Localstorage API is used to store user data.

In Forget your password i generate reset code which will generate randomly every time.
